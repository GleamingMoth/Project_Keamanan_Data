we do not have deal to enter for this . you need to look at the entire midtex
line for each of the days that are out of balance . if we are short at katy ,
i would think that we would be long at dewville . ( many times , our receipts
from the midtex line at katy are offset by our deliveries to tufco at the
tap . ) this should help you fix the january problem . also , for december , you
may need to ask pg & e where they show the delivery for western . is it at hpl
katy , as our records show , or is it at pge ' s another point on the midtex
line ? in any case , we don ' t have deliveries to make . the only other remedy
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance .

we are still having problem with this meter . from what i understand of our

contracts whole . in the case where we have excess flow the hpl ( r ) contract
takes the swing . so in the case where we are short , shouldn ' t we have a hpl

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

ena is using tetco ' s volume and hplc is using the hpl measurement volume ,
causing a desk to desk variance .

3 ) transco bammel meter 74 - transco and hpl ' s nominations are out of
balance at meter 74 . charlotte needs to work with transco to resolve .
4 ) dow meter 4486 - the sale to entex needs to be taken off of hplc meter
4486 and the sale needs to be at dow meter 4486 .
a desk to desk between ena ( buyer )
and hplc ( seller ) needs to be set up on dow meter 4486 .
ami needs to set up the deals and
thu needs to coordinate the months involved .
once this is done and thu
reallocates to dow pipeline , jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and
make the meter non allocatable in pops .

in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .

as you ' re aware , we ' re having to bridge houston street ids into unify from
sitara .
we are being asked , as a requirement , to not display the eol id on statements
that are identified as "" broker eol trade "" deals originating from eol . we
have two options to accomodate this requirement :
option 1 is to have the modify the bridge code to not bridge over the eol
deal id if the deal is a "" broker eol trade "" deal . one of the drawbacks of
this option is that you won ' t be able to referenence the eol id on the path
manager for these related deals . all other deals will have the eol deal id ,
if applicable . the eol id would not show up on the statements because it
wouldn ' t be populated .
option 2 is to modify several areas of code in the settlements area which may
be more time consuming . the obvious code change would be in the statement
generation area as well as other report type information .
option 2 allows you the greatest flexibility while option 1 may be quicker to
implement .
please pass this along to others in your group and get feedback . please
share your thoughts . . . .
i ' ve attached an email explaining the broker eol trades . this is not to be
confused with broker deals done at a given point with not transportation .
these will continue to come across as you ' d normally expect .

subject : re : meter 5892
daren :
sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue , i am with ees now .
karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while i was in transition .
exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis .
december 2000
the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this
e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at
this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will
show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine .
january 2001
again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu
flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other
deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get
this issue resolved .
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024
contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue .

we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?

in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the

hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a

hpl or channel .
on the second contract : is hpl making the sale or ena ? is it a sale that is going

can hpl sever the point some other way ?

20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and

invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .",0,1,5.2128535754480954e-05,False Positive

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual

based on what index ?

"Subject: sec information / earnings restatement
today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ;
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at .
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments .",0,1,0.00019853959612886607,False Positive

koch never returned my calls . based on the contractual information , we may be
putting ourselves in a risk area by ' assigning ' the deals without proper
documentation . the documentation that was supplied did not refence any ena
agreements , nor any specific meter numbers . if the purchase was indeed a
meter / well sale ; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired
and the effective date . since we are apparently the supplier , the risk is not

i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a "" synergi "" contract number ) . i know that in
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues . karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally .

subject : tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

"Subject: update - supported internet email addresses
earlier this week , enron global technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non - standard internet email address formats . as mentioned in the previous communication , this was the first of several communications to be sent by the enron global technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our email environment .
we are working toward a cut - off date of january 14 , 2002 , at which time we will no longer support email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname . lastname @ enron . com ( or firstname . middleinitial . lastname @ enron . com if your name in lotus notes or outlook has a middle initial in it ) . we understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard email address format , but it is important to begin making the change now .
if you have questions , please send an email to enron . messaging . administration @ enron . com .

subject : supported internet email addresses
enron global technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non - standard internet email address formats . the only internet email address format that will be supported , once this effort is completed , is firstname . lastname @ enron . com . we will no longer support internet email address formats such as name @ enron . com , name @ ect . enron . com , name @ ei . enron . com ( where "" name "" is an abbreviation , acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and / or lastname ) . every enron employee has an internet email address of firstname . lastname @ enron . com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this internet address format if they are not using it already .
any new / existing application systems or business cards that reference a non - supported internet email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet address format . it is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending internet email to any non - supported internet email addresses .
to determine what your supported internet email address is , take your name as it appears in outlook or lotus notes and replace any "" spaces "" that appear in your name with periods and append @ enron . com . for example in outlook , alan smith , robert ( firstname = robert , lastname = alan smith ) will have a supported internet email address of robert . alan . smith @ enron . com .
important : if you need to update your business card ( s ) to reflect your supported internet email address , please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards . if you experience any issues with delivery of internet email to your supported internet email address , please contact the resolution center .
we will communicate further details , including the cut - off date , in the coming weeks . meanwhile , it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet email address format . if you have questions regarding this email , send an email to enron . messaging . administration @ enron . com .

i have forwarded your e - mail to the people in our shop that will be working
most directly on this project . tom hodges has talked with kerry puckett in
our bd group . they have set a meeting up for tues . 10 / 02 / 01 . we can setup
a confidentiality agreement if you want , that would probably allow us to
discuss storage options in the area more freely . since you are out today
i ' ll see if i can ' t get rick moncrief to send over a form of agreement we
have used , they all look pretty similar . as far as deal structure i ' m
pretty open on how we setup , but am definitely interested in equity
partnership / jv . as this is our core area of assets we wish to continue to
be actively involved in deals that we believe add value .
i believe there is significant potential to create a trading platform
utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity sres ' s system supply
could create at an expanded waha hub .
rick ' s group will be taking the point on this project and will coordinate
others involvement as necessary within our company .
we look forward to working with you and your team on this project .

changes to the plan , only breaking the gas asset group into smaller buckets .
any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are not

allocations , and they will require explanations each month as all variances
from plan do . this includes new rc ' s which have set up , etc .

denver business - allocate to rocky mountain asset originations
if you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them ,

julie ,
in 1996 , a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing ,
contract numbers 078 - 86978 - 101 / 078 - 86978 - 301 . in april ' 99 , these contracts
were assigned to ect . in october of 1998 , these contracts should have been
assigned to hplc , but did not get assigned . beginning in jan . ' 99 , negative
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara
# 18372 ( meter # 6884 ) , causing my payments to be reduced . i believe that the
deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract . ( the
purchase deal numbers which i have been using are sitara # 14086 and sitara
# 11079 ) . both these sales and purchases ( since october ' 98 ) are suppose to
be for hplc . donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc ' s
between teco and hplc can be set up from october of 1998 until the master
contract is changed . amelia alland has set these up , which i believe
terminate in october ' 99 . the gtc spot contract numbers are as follows :
purchases : 012 - 86978 - 102 ; global 96021450
sales : 012 - 86978 - 301 ; global 96021451
per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments ?
when complete , can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be ?

susan ,
hope you had a great new year and holiday season ! i have a couple of issues
i want ot clear up for this year ' s contract .
the question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you
are currently pulling gas . our new contract that was just sent to you has a
minimum take of 60 , 000 mmbtu ( estimated 35 , 000 @ 8018 celanese , 15 , 000 @ 1233
texas city , and 10 , 000 @ 1394 dodge street ) . if you undertake at any meter
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60 , 000
mmbtu . my accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out . we discussed
this on the phone and i got your consent to split these invoices . now we are
being told all three invoices need to be separate . since we always aim to
please the customer , here is my recommendation for handling the contract
through it ' s term . please let me know if this is fine .
celanese 35 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
35 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
texas city 15 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
15 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid

dodge street 10 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

shawna ,
attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

decided to look it up and do it myself . tom was very pleased .
2 . tom gave that info to ed , and he asked for further data :
a . about cinco ranch , greatwood , and spring interconnects
i coordinated with brad blevins and applied it to the fact that origination

issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of
these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought
you two might want to dicsuss these issues .
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know .
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated .
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ?
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to
the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned
issues .
hank eisenhours duties were split :
mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,
december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .
carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all
offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey
also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas
for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .
hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .
hpl operational seems to be left unassigned .
i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks
responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .",0,1,0.001059449839576676,False Positive

sorry it took me so long to get back to you . pg & e did not fully process the
gas stream at their indian springs plant on december 12 and 13 and took the
reduced shrinkage , 19 . 000 mmbtu / d , and sold it to hpl at gas daily - $ 0 . 04 .
pg & e did not have the right to do that , so they are going to allocate that
volume to comstock , from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month
index . at the same time pg & e will create an imbalance , for which they will
pay hpl the same amount hpl paid them for the gas for those two days . this
should wash the sale at gas daily and leave hpl buying the gas at the
beginning of the month ifhsc ( the price in the comstock purchase contract )
and selling it at the gas daily price for 12 / 12 and 12 / 13 . the paperwork is
on its way to me to close this issue out .

sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal i have attached below .
apparently we bot from pge industrial on the 12 th and 13 th . pg & e has
allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to teco , and claim that they are
net deals . i do not show a sale in the system at the meter , and i checked
the 215 k for those days for a corresponding delivery to teco , perhaps at
another meter , and could not find one .
any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated .

"Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .

subject : update on employee expense reimbursement
post - petition expenses
effective immediately , the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after enron corp . ' s chapter 11 filing ( after december 2 nd ) has returned to normal . expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission . employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors . new travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming . in the meantime , please use discretion as you incur expenses . all expenditures should be made with consideration given to enron ' s current financial situation .
pre - petition expenses
we will immediately begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses for current and former employees ( incurred prior to the december 2 nd chapter 11 filing ) up to a maximum of $ 5 , 000 . we understand that a number of employees have pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . however , under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court , there is a $ 15 , 000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre - petition compensation , benefits , and related employee expenses . this $ 15 , 000 cap was imposed without input from enron management and counsel . we have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $ 15 , 000 cap does not include the reimbursement of medical , dental , or vision related expenses .
we have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical / dental / vision expense issue , we will begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 and up to $ 15 , 000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $ 15 , 000 cap . unfortunately , since this will be a manual process , it will take some time to work through . employees with pre - petition business expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation , including the total amount of pending pre - petition medical / dental / vision claims , to expensereport @ enron . com .

it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad
array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .
enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we
have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over
$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .
we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for
enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .
replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron
north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive
committee .
global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net
works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as
an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology
officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .
enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now
be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the
following individuals are included in enron net works along with their
current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay

donna ,
a request was brought up this week that i would like you to run by the
managers for input :
- add the deal price to the sales and supply list windows of path manager
this seems more significant based on the transactions from eol .
this has been mentioned in the past , but has had some related "" baggage "" :
- impact on performance , may run slower . could make it an option so you pay
the price when you need it .
- ability to show tier info . maybe just use the work "" tiered "" and not try
to represent the actual pricing
- agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and
fixed price offset ( ie 98 % of if . transco . znl + . 02 )
this column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user
preference .

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can
see the numbers .

signs such as , "" a & m wants a fair game ! whoooooop ! "" students ' thoughts
echoed their signs . "" all we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner , "" says student karen hays , an aggie from marfa . "" we need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner . ""
abc , around 2 : 00 pm central time , had mistakenly declared a & m the winner ,
despite the slim 3 point lead the aggies held at that point . at about 2 : 30
pm , with the game still too close to call , abc had to back off its
prediction .
college football analyst brent musburger made the call . "" we felt that with
a number of points still not added in by jamaar tombs and the aggies , we
were certain a & m would carry this game . we may have been premature in our
prediction . ""

gary , mainline valves to be closed on the 18 "" 3026 line are as follows :
u - 5 at crown street and u - 6 at the end of the line where ship channel loop
3026 line ties into the shell west 4792 line .
it is my understanding that the following customers within this outage
section currently take gas :
air products meter 1418
albemarle meter 1188
the current schedule would call for an outage to start on 4 / 13 / 00 and be back
in service on 4 / 16 / 00 .

the pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised .
actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be
3 days max . this outage time , which is longer than the norm , is due to the
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
ditch before tie ins take place .
as an update , the first train is now scheduled to cross late today . they now
say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are
able to begin replacing our line .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
i have been advised by the deer park rr representative , dean truitt , that
the rail cars will begin arriving on 3 / 15 / 00 .
per our conversations today , please have someone on tuesday 3 / 13 adjust the
regulators at simpson and at shell deer park so that 280 psig is the maximum
pressure in that pipeline section .
i will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
keep you informed . it is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
will be on the order of 2 weeks .
after the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility , deer
park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
replacement at that location . this replacement would involve an outage on
this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days . i would anticipate that
this outage would occur in early april .
thanks for your cooperation in this matter .

mary ,
hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december ,
1999 . typically , before hpl physically pulls a meter , production has ceased
at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of
the roos common point , the producing wells were released and attached to
meter 0989740 in 11 / 98 and the remaining wells are non - producing .
resultingly , the only viable option for resolution is option 2 . we should
take the deal to zero by "" unwinding "" it .

subject : re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,

subject : houston gas & power controls / standards assessment
as you all are aware , there is a heightened awareness throughout the company
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success
at achieving those standards . i have been asked by sally to take the lead on
meeting this objective . for the last several weeks , i have been involved in
an extensive review of the london office controls and procedures for their
gas and power trading businesses . we have used the findings of this review
to start developing an assessment of controls , standards and measurement
methodology for the london office .
in order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards
across enron , we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment
for the houston gas and power businesses ( we will assess global products and
other commodities traded at a later date ) . i will be in houston tuesday and
wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process .
i have scheduled a meeting next weds . , may 17 from 9 : 00 - 11 : 30 in eb 49 cl so
that we may review our controls , define the standards of meeting those
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not
operating properly . before that meeting , i would like for all of you to
develop for your respective functional responsibilities the following :
- a listing of all controls your group is responsible for ( i . e . cash
collections are timely )
- a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its
maximum effectiveness ( i . e . cash is collected within 30 days of deal date
with exceptions noted )
- a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard
( i . e . % of cash collected within 30 days )
- a description of current capabilities to calculate , track and report each
measurement ( i . e . automated a / r aging report )
i would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads . a lot of
work has already been done to identify this information so i would hope time
requirements for this will not be extensive . i have attached a worksheet to
be completed with the information discussed above . i have also attached a
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but
it is certainly not all - inclusive and should be revised as necessary .
as discussed above , we will review the controls and standards listings for
each functional group in the weds . meeting and also assess the risk
associated with each control . i would like to achieve consensus on gas and
power operating standards for houston by the end of the meeting . let me know
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process . i look forward
to seeing you next week .",0,1,0.012346938260565266,False Positive

i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any

"Subject: organisational announcement - introducing enron global markets
as evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter ,
enron  , s wholesale energy businesses in north america and europe continue to
experience tremendous growth . the opportunities to continue to grow our
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to
enron  , s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets .
it is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of
gas and electricity , which can make significant contributions to our earnings
growth . we have made significant progress in developing these businesses in
north america , europe , and most recently in our new net works business unit .
included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products ,
coal , emissions , insurance , currency , equity trading , interest rates , credit
trading , paper and pulp , and metals .
while significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in north america
and europe . in order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today
announcing the formation of a new business unit  ) enron global markets . this
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in
scope , but outside our traditional gas and power markets . this new core
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with
the north american and european businesses .
enron global markets will be headed by mike mcconnell , president and chief
executive officer , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer . they will
report to mark frevert who will be chairman of enron global markets . mark ,
mike and jeff will comprise the office of the chairman for enron global
markets .
included in this new business unit and reporting to the office of the
chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders :
- global crude and products : john nowlan
- coal : george mcclellan
- currency , equities , interest rate and agricultural trading : gary hickerson
- insurance and weather : jere overdyke
enron  , s metals business and enron credit . com will remain the responsibility
of enron europe . the paper and pulp business will continue to reside in north
america .
with the departure of mike mcconnell from enron net works , we are pleased to
announce the following appointments in that business unit :
- jeff mcmahon : president and chief operating officer
- louise kitchen : chief commercial officer
- philippe bibi : chief technology officer
jeff , louise and philippe , along with greg whalley , will comprise the office
of the chairman for enron net works .
with jeff shankman  , s departure from enron north america  , s natural gas
operation , all of jeff  , s direct reports will report to john lavorato .
we are also pleased to announce the following changes to the enron north
america office of the chairman . john lavorato will join the ena office of
the chairman as chief operating officer . dave delainey will assume the role
of president and chief executive officer . mark frevert will retain his role
as chairman of enron north america in addition to his role as chairman of
both enron global markets and enron europe .

"Subject: organizational changes
we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes
are intended to accomplish four key objectives :
first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful
business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .
this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built
around a relatively small strategic asset position .
second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting
relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to
directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units
has become increasingly difficult .
third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding
asset positions .
and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .
enron wholesale services
today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate
our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale
businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and
coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to
higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of
opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of
enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and
markets .
enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european
( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets
operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit
as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant
businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this
new structure as described below .
mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume
the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,
currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office
of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .
providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership
positions :
rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president
and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility
for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north
america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo
will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will
report to the ews office of the chairman .
sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the
middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our
broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region
will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of
the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for
enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business
into enron global assets in the near future .
diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined
ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will
focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to
the ebs office of the chairman .
jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees
to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order
to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to
facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for
at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south
america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to
the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the
transition , jim will join ees .
in addition to these changes in our international asset operations
activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale
businesses and the commercial support functions :
enron net works
louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and
ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .
enron americas
concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for
operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,
marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report
into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility
for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south
america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief
operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron
americas .
enron europe
the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia
and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john
sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .
enron global markets
enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and
ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have
responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the
exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and
associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to
enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the
commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,
equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .
enron industrial markets
enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,
president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .
commercial support for ews
the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,
the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in
the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .
to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across
ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these
newly defined roles are as follows :
mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office
operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,
with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice
president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated
services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these
services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible
for specific commodities and / or geographic locations .
legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews .
regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a
regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in
the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all
european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue
to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions
and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief
of staff .
public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional
basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity ,
enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue
in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler
will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as
well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets .
these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship
to mark palmer , vice president of communications .
business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover
ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america .
attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale
services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes .
enron global exploration and production
and enron wind
as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments
around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to
egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff
baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron
wind , will report to cliff .
corporate staff
we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources ,
government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in
that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and
community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and
chief of staff .
committee structure
in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s
growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our
business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to
be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and
the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be
drawing on this group to lead company - wide initiatives such as the
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses .
the executive committee membership is shown on the attached list .
we are also forming a new committee  ) the enron corporate policy committee .
this group will be responsible for overall corporate policy , personnel
management policy and corporate strategy . the enron corporate policy
committee membership is also shown on the attached list .
we are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to
our highest return opportunities . please join us in congratulating and
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles .",0,1,0.006118589000687125,False Positive

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .

good afternoon everyone ,
i would like to present megan jones for consideration of the sr . specialist
position ( job 103143 )
as for your essential requirements , she meets and exceeds them all .
accounting degree from ut , very detailed , knowledge of the gas industry ,
excellent communication skills , and over 2 years of experience .
regarding essential functions , she could perform them right away . her
resume shows detail of experience .
megan left coral energy to get into a department at sonat which would
provide her more of a challenge . she was truly being utilized as a
"" bean - counter "" and wanted more interaction with others . she went to work at
sonat which she says is the best job she ever had . she enjoyed the company ,
people , everything . . . as you know , sonat was bought by el paso which ended
her position along with others in her department .
she honestly took her current position in haste , but also thought it would
give her the experience of using her accounting skills , but having more
interaction with others in an audit capacity . this has not been the case .
she misses the industry , and learns quickly , very social and has no problem
interacting with people at all levels .
let me know your thoughts and any questions you may have .
best regards ,
sharon

i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

madonna enrolls at prestigious university
pop queen madonna is so frustrated she sacrificed her education for pop music - she ' s allegedly enrolled at britain ' s prestigious oxford university for a degree in english literature . the material girl rekindled her love of books after writing popular children ' s series the english roses , and is looking forward to studying for a bachelor of arts qualification from home , with the celebrated institution which counts four british kings , 47 nobel prize - winners , 25 british prime ministers and six saints as past students . an insider tells britain ' s the sun newspaper , madonna was always irritated about giving up her schooling when her career took off . she is fiercely intelligent and incredibly well read and has always taken a keen interest in literature . she is determined to get a qualification . she sets herself new challenges all the time and the oxford university course is her latest . it ' s an illustrious place to study and she was delighted to be accepted and will make the most of the opportunity .
see madonna absolutely naked at our site . see also other celebrities naked , exposed .

"Subject: this was the one recommended to me
finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

i think i ' m younkger than main target group of cialdis consumers , but i
have a very hard work , i always had to listen about people ' s failures , about bad life et cetera .
all that problems affected my selxual activity , my wife was not as happy as before with me .
i tried viagras - both genedric and pfdizer ' s , but they does not act as good and as long as i want it to be .

i ' d recommend it to anybody with erectlion troubles .

"Subject: from mrs . juliana
dear friend ,
please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you .
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm .
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on
diplomatic
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five
hundred
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed
the
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does
not know
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes /
consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons .
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries
and
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of
people
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was
one
of
the victims .
it is against this background that , all my family members fled
zimbabwe
for fear of our
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort
political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late
husband ' s
money to a more
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the
money is not being used ,
lying in the security company .
i must let you know that this transaction is
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents .
if you accept to assist us , do please contact our
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to
be done to finalize all the arrangements with
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after
reaching a workable agreement with you .
barrister hope martins law chambers ,
e - mail : hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in
the
custody of the diplomatic firm .
he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with
your advice
this matter require maturity and trust .
regards ,
mrs . juliana mbuluku
for : ( the family ) .
please you can read about problems in zimbabwe from

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

now that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search
yields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review
of the two systems .
i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit ,
both with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via
an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca
adapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and
sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest .
the bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in
sound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel
quality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more
channels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) .
after careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have
said . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and
are streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its
oft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm
has an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored
comedy ) , and a few more "" experimental "" music channels which most will find
totally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular
( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s
no wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you
buy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion .
the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are
the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the
corporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying
in an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that
makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up
loud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) .
this , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my
cancelling xm .
xm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent
music and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept
xm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no
matter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered
everything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the
talk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the
useful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan .
xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius
also has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) .
however , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all
have to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for
the house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where
the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows .",1,0,-0.0026579917452783652,False Negative

understandably , we are not acqainted . i do not even know if you will be
reliable and trustworthy , but i believe that everything starts with a first
