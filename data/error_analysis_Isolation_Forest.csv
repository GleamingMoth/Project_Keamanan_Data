in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3

the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary

once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be

coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

july 2000 - deal # 871172 has an interconnect issue . according to mops contract # 105124 , they received 8 , 275 dth
on the matagorda 624 , but according to epgt , they delivered 10 , 362 dth to hpl ( ? ) could this possibly
need to be split somehow , or do you have any other ideas ?

tenaska iv has been operating without a "" gas agency agreement "" since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
through the bank consent process ?

subject : pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .

we are being asked , as a requirement , to not display the eol id on statements
that are identified as "" broker eol trade "" deals originating from eol . we
have two options to accomodate this requirement :
option 1 is to have the modify the bridge code to not bridge over the eol
deal id if the deal is a "" broker eol trade "" deal . one of the drawbacks of
this option is that you won ' t be able to referenence the eol id on the path
manager for these related deals . all other deals will have the eol deal id ,
if applicable . the eol id would not show up on the statements because it
wouldn ' t be populated .
option 2 is to modify several areas of code in the settlements area which may
be more time consuming . the obvious code change would be in the statement
generation area as well as other report type information .
option 2 allows you the greatest flexibility while option 1 may be quicker to
implement .
please pass this along to others in your group and get feedback . please
share your thoughts . . . .

december 2000
the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this
e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at
this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will
show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine .
january 2001
again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu
flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other
deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get
this issue resolved .
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024
contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue .

let ' s not assume what impact this will have . even though it is better to zero out deals we ( vm ) wouldn ' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals .
we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?

"Subject: pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?

"Subject: sec information / earnings restatement
today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ;
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at .
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments .",0,1,0.012456312448897722,False Positive

of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual

according to brian kerns of duke , they basically took assignment of the

transportation agreement enron had with pg & e ( now el paso ) . if this is the
case , then we should be using the nominated amount as the driver towards
meeting
our monthly minimum purchase obligation . any imbalance between enron and duke
on the duke system receipts would be transparent to txu and worked out between
enron and duke . any imbalance between the nominated volumed and the actual

the cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to cilco . please

january 2000 . cilco withdrew 200 , 000 mmbtu ' s more than we booked @ bammel .
please let me know the best way to correct the problem . i suspect the
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance . also , the nomination for
the current month is 7 , 327 mmbtu instead of 7 , 000 mmbtu per day . 7 , 000 is
the volume delivered to cilco after transport fuel .

i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a "" synergi "" contract number ) . i know that in
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues . karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally .

subject : tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

subject : supported internet email addresses
enron global technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non - standard internet email address formats . the only internet email address format that will be supported , once this effort is completed , is firstname . lastname @ enron . com . we will no longer support internet email address formats such as name @ enron . com , name @ ect . enron . com , name @ ei . enron . com ( where "" name "" is an abbreviation , acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and / or lastname ) . every enron employee has an internet email address of firstname . lastname @ enron . com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this internet address format if they are not using it already .
any new / existing application systems or business cards that reference a non - supported internet email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet address format . it is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending internet email to any non - supported internet email addresses .
to determine what your supported internet email address is , take your name as it appears in outlook or lotus notes and replace any "" spaces "" that appear in your name with periods and append @ enron . com . for example in outlook , alan smith , robert ( firstname = robert , lastname = alan smith ) will have a supported internet email address of robert . alan . smith @ enron . com .
important : if you need to update your business card ( s ) to reflect your supported internet email address , please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards . if you experience any issues with delivery of internet email to your supported internet email address , please contact the resolution center .
we will communicate further details , including the cut - off date , in the coming weeks . meanwhile , it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet email address format . if you have questions regarding this email , send an email to enron . messaging . administration @ enron . com .
thank you for participation , cooperation and support .

brian ,
i have forwarded your e - mail to the people in our shop that will be working
most directly on this project . tom hodges has talked with kerry puckett in
our bd group . they have set a meeting up for tues . 10 / 02 / 01 . we can setup
a confidentiality agreement if you want , that would probably allow us to
discuss storage options in the area more freely . since you are out today
i ' ll see if i can ' t get rick moncrief to send over a form of agreement we
have used , they all look pretty similar . as far as deal structure i ' m
pretty open on how we setup , but am definitely interested in equity
partnership / jv . as this is our core area of assets we wish to continue to
be actively involved in deals that we believe add value .
i believe there is significant potential to create a trading platform
utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity sres ' s system supply
could create at an expanded waha hub .
rick ' s group will be taking the point on this project and will coordinate
others involvement as necessary within our company .
we look forward to working with you and your team on this project .

receive questions from the commercial teams , so document your logic . some
things to consider :
project sally - allocate to gas network development
project hurricane - allocate to ? ? ? ? - ( i have a call into jim coffey )
denver business - allocate to rocky mountain asset originations
if you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them ,
either call me , jackie nelson or jim coffey .

what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .

prior to 7 / 99 this was ena not hpl , but there may be some issues on it as well for 3 / 99 to 6 / 99 . the deal ticket we used was 62717 . i will have to look further into the ena activity because i know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other .

i am trying to get some payments out to williams for old months 11 / 2000 and 1 / 2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have black marlin pipeline company inc . instead of black marlin pipeline company effective 3 / 99 . the black marlin pipeline company was for an internal record ( when it was an enron entity ) .",0,1,0.008671415377422054,False Positive
"Subject: re : hl & p for 12 / 99
it is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers ,
however , if the pipeline allocates the shortage to ena then we need to follow
the contract language and bill accordingly . just remember that we allowed
makeup on the 18 , 19 , & 20 th for a total volume of 5 k over 3 days so that
will apply toward the 4 th and part of the 9 th . all other volumes should be
purchased back per the language in the contract . remember they have a
tolerance of 5 % below the nomination .

susan ,
hope you had a great new year and holiday season ! i have a couple of issues
i want ot clear up for this year ' s contract .
the question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you
are currently pulling gas . our new contract that was just sent to you has a
minimum take of 60 , 000 mmbtu ( estimated 35 , 000 @ 8018 celanese , 15 , 000 @ 1233
texas city , and 10 , 000 @ 1394 dodge street ) . if you undertake at any meter
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60 , 000
mmbtu . my accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out . we discussed
this on the phone and i got your consent to split these invoices . now we are
being told all three invoices need to be separate . since we always aim to
please the customer , here is my recommendation for handling the contract
through it ' s term . please let me know if this is fine .
celanese 35 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
35 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
texas city 15 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
15 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
dodge street 10 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
10 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
any excess volumes taken at all three locations would be billed @ gd hsc high

"Subject: re : big cowboy / gepl actuals for february
please see the attached xcel file . i think that i have found the missing volumes on big cowboy . there are two wells connected to system 429 , which flows into the big cowboy system and interconnects with hgpl at meter 8284 . they are meters 986679 ( currently in trade zone 18 ) and 986742 ( currently in trade zone 1 ) . i think that these should probably both be reassigned to trade zone 21 . this should resolve our volumetric issue .
donna & george ,
please let me know if my assumption is in error . i have a schematic that shows these meters going to hgpl off of gepl big cowboy , however , if this is not correct then i will need to try to find the gas in another manner .

to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its

sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s

i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments
and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current
issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of
these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought
you two might want to dicsuss these issues .
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know .
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated .
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ?
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to
the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned
issues .
hank eisenhours duties were split :
mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,
december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .
carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all
offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey
also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas
for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .
hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .
hpl operational seems to be left unassigned .

sorry it took me so long to get back to you . pg & e did not fully process the
gas stream at their indian springs plant on december 12 and 13 and took the
reduced shrinkage , 19 . 000 mmbtu / d , and sold it to hpl at gas daily - $ 0 . 04 .
pg & e did not have the right to do that , so they are going to allocate that
volume to comstock , from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month
index . at the same time pg & e will create an imbalance , for which they will
pay hpl the same amount hpl paid them for the gas for those two days . this
should wash the sale at gas daily and leave hpl buying the gas at the
beginning of the month ifhsc ( the price in the comstock purchase contract )
and selling it at the gas daily price for 12 / 12 and 12 / 13 . the paperwork is
on its way to me to close this issue out .

"Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .

we are not receiving timely information from the hub regarding our park and lend agreement . i have not received an update since tues or wed of last week . mike has been phoning them furiously for information and has been told that they don ' t have it , or it will be ready later . per gisb , final scheduled numbers on epng , nng , and tw are reported at 9 : 00 am the following day ( ie . sunday final will be out at 9 am on mon . ) . prior to the transition from pg & e , we received our balance by 9 : 15 or 9 : 30 am . i realize that the transition has been difficult , they are never a cake walk , however , this type of information is crucial . further , they have not provided any final numbers for the month of april , we should at least be able to receive a "" best available "" number , and the interstate pipes , due to gisb , have final scheduled numbers available on the first of the month . i submit that ena should not be held liable for payment of the $ 0 . 03 / day rate , as we have not received the information we need to balance the agreement . if epgt plans to administer fees , then balance information should be communicated on a timely basis . we may want to check the terms of the agreement , and / or negotiate a reduced rate for the month of may .

effective immediately , the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after enron corp .

we have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical / dental / vision expense issue , we will begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 and up to $ 15 , 000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $ 15 , 000 cap . unfortunately , since this will be a manual process , it will take some time to work through . employees with pre - petition business expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation , including the total amount of pending pre - petition medical / dental / vision claims , to expensereport @ enron . com .

ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 17 , 2001
ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity
given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline .
existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities .
"" by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , "" the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] .
existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . "" but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . ""
given the lack of "" consensus supporting "" gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to "" resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , "" the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 .
the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders .
but the commission discounted these arguments . "" . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , "" the nopr noted .",0,1,0.011291726201753283,False Positive

"Subject: enron net works
it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad
array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries .
enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we
have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over
$ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world .
we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for
enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .
replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron
north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive
committee .
global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net
works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as
an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology
officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .
enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now
be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the
following individuals are included in enron net works along with their
current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay
fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,
pulp and paper .
over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational

a request was brought up this week that i would like you to run by the
managers for input :
- add the deal price to the sales and supply list windows of path manager
this seems more significant based on the transactions from eol .
this has been mentioned in the past , but has had some related "" baggage "" :
- impact on performance , may run slower . could make it an option so you pay
the price when you need it .
- ability to show tier info . maybe just use the work "" tiered "" and not try
to represent the actual pricing
- agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and
fixed price offset ( ie 98 % of if . transco . znl + . 02 )
this column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user
preference .

college station , tx ( ap ) - r . c . slocum and the texas a & m aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which oklahoma won 35 to 31 . "" the end
zones were confusing , "" says slocum . "" i ' m sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in oklahoma ' s end zone were meant to go into ours . we were
scoring in those end zones also . oklahoma would never have scored
thirty - five points . there ' s no way we lost this one . a & m demands a
recount . ""
oklahoma officials are calling this "" outrageous "" . "" they agreed to the size ,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick - off , "" replies ou coach
bob stoops . "" if they had a problem with them , they should have said so
before we started . you don ' t get to keep playing until you ' re happy with
the outcome . someone had to lose . we ' ve scored over thirty - five points
many times . ""
a & m has sent lawyers , farmers , and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to kyle field , where the scoreboard will be tested . "" we
are confident that when the points are re - totaled , we will be the winner of
the game , "" says slocum .
ou also points out that in many games prior to this one , the same end zones
were used . "" they didn ' t have a problem with the end zones until they lost , ""
says stoops .
outside of kyle field , a & m student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as , "" a & m wants a fair game ! whoooooop ! "" students ' thoughts
echoed their signs . "" all we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner , "" says student karen hays , an aggie from marfa . "" we need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner . ""
abc , around 2 : 00 pm central time , had mistakenly declared a & m the winner ,
despite the slim 3 point lead the aggies held at that point . at about 2 : 30
pm , with the game still too close to call , abc had to back off its
prediction .
college football analyst brent musburger made the call . "" we felt that with
a number of points still not added in by jamaar tombs and the aggies , we
were certain a & m would carry this game . we may have been premature in our
prediction . ""

u - 5 at crown street and u - 6 at the end of the line where ship channel loop
3026 line ties into the shell west 4792 line .
it is my understanding that the following customers within this outage
section currently take gas :
air products meter 1418
albemarle meter 1188
the current schedule would call for an outage to start on 4 / 13 / 00 and be back

the pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised .
actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be
3 days max . this outage time , which is longer than the norm , is due to the
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
ditch before tie ins take place .
as an update , the first train is now scheduled to cross late today . they now
say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are

pressure in that pipeline section .
i will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
keep you informed . it is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
will be on the order of 2 weeks .
after the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility , deer
park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
replacement at that location . this replacement would involve an outage on
this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days . i would anticipate that
this outage would occur in early april .
thanks for your cooperation in this matter .

this means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to

the month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month

hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december ,
1999 . typically , before hpl physically pulls a meter , production has ceased
at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of
the roos common point , the producing wells were released and attached to

vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .

this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice .

to be as conservative as possible . i would like to sign off on all replacements . i promise not to be difficult .

dynegy and i don ' t have access to it . i ' m on the east desk . yesterday i
extended the deal 421415 for the 6 th and 19 th and meredith inserted a path in
unify - tetco to cover the small overflow volume between hpl and ena . the
ena / hpl piece is done . the piece between hpl and dynegy is what you need

i don ' t want to tell you to add any contracts , because i am not sure about
that . i am just saying if you look at ray ' s schedule there are 2 deals out
there , one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy . the
track id i gave you was for ena . you cannot allocate the dynegy piece
until i give you a track id . i cannot give you a track id until the deal is
extended for days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 .

jackie ,
you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the
interconnect report .

your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where
strangers gas is allocated . i have created an accounting arrangement for
these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena
portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days . deal 422516 ( purchase
from dynegy ) needs to be extended for these 2 days so i can do an accounting
arrangement . alfonso i need for you to allocate your meter daily , because

concerned with the long weekend coming up . i believe that we agreed that
these would be set up by the 3 rd work day , which would be friday the 7 th .
( six days of flow . ) i definitely don ' t think that we should any later . it
would be great if this could be handled sooner , miimizing our economic impact .
additionally , we need to get the industrial spreadsheet up and running
again . this report is very beneficial to gas control , industrial traders and

subject : houston gas & power controls / standards assessment
as you all are aware , there is a heightened awareness throughout the company
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success
at achieving those standards . i have been asked by sally to take the lead on
meeting this objective . for the last several weeks , i have been involved in
an extensive review of the london office controls and procedures for their
gas and power trading businesses . we have used the findings of this review
to start developing an assessment of controls , standards and measurement
methodology for the london office .
in order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards
across enron , we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment
for the houston gas and power businesses ( we will assess global products and
other commodities traded at a later date ) . i will be in houston tuesday and
wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process .
i have scheduled a meeting next weds . , may 17 from 9 : 00 - 11 : 30 in eb 49 cl so
that we may review our controls , define the standards of meeting those
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not
operating properly . before that meeting , i would like for all of you to
develop for your respective functional responsibilities the following :
- a listing of all controls your group is responsible for ( i . e . cash
collections are timely )
- a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its
maximum effectiveness ( i . e . cash is collected within 30 days of deal date
with exceptions noted )
- a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard
( i . e . % of cash collected within 30 days )
- a description of current capabilities to calculate , track and report each
measurement ( i . e . automated a / r aging report )
i would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads . a lot of
work has already been done to identify this information so i would hope time
requirements for this will not be extensive . i have attached a worksheet to
be completed with the information discussed above . i have also attached a
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but
it is certainly not all - inclusive and should be revised as necessary .
as discussed above , we will review the controls and standards listings for
each functional group in the weds . meeting and also assess the risk
associated with each control . i would like to achieve consensus on gas and
power operating standards for houston by the end of the meeting . let me know
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process . i look forward
to seeing you next week .",0,1,0.02166685213354813,False Positive

"Subject: organisational announcement - introducing enron global markets
as evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter ,
enron  , s wholesale energy businesses in north america and europe continue to
experience tremendous growth . the opportunities to continue to grow our
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to
enron  , s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets .
it is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of
gas and electricity , which can make significant contributions to our earnings
growth . we have made significant progress in developing these businesses in
north america , europe , and most recently in our new net works business unit .
included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products ,
coal , emissions , insurance , currency , equity trading , interest rates , credit
trading , paper and pulp , and metals .
while significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in north america
and europe . in order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today
announcing the formation of a new business unit  ) enron global markets . this
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in
scope , but outside our traditional gas and power markets . this new core
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with
the north american and european businesses .
enron global markets will be headed by mike mcconnell , president and chief
executive officer , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer . they will
report to mark frevert who will be chairman of enron global markets . mark ,
mike and jeff will comprise the office of the chairman for enron global
markets .
included in this new business unit and reporting to the office of the
chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders :
- global crude and products : john nowlan
- coal : george mcclellan
- currency , equities , interest rate and agricultural trading : gary hickerson
- insurance and weather : jere overdyke
enron  , s metals business and enron credit . com will remain the responsibility
of enron europe . the paper and pulp business will continue to reside in north
america .
with the departure of mike mcconnell from enron net works , we are pleased to
announce the following appointments in that business unit :
- jeff mcmahon : president and chief operating officer
- louise kitchen : chief commercial officer
- philippe bibi : chief technology officer
jeff , louise and philippe , along with greg whalley , will comprise the office
of the chairman for enron net works .
with jeff shankman  , s departure from enron north america  , s natural gas
operation , all of jeff  , s direct reports will report to john lavorato .
we are also pleased to announce the following changes to the enron north
america office of the chairman . john lavorato will join the ena office of
the chairman as chief operating officer . dave delainey will assume the role
of president and chief executive officer . mark frevert will retain his role
as chairman of enron north america in addition to his role as chairman of
both enron global markets and enron europe .
please join us in congratulating everyone in their new assignments and in
supporting the new enron global markets organisation .",0,1,0.02112770287727722,False Positive
"Subject: organizational changes
we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes
are intended to accomplish four key objectives :
first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful
business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .
this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built
around a relatively small strategic asset position .
second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting
relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to
directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units
has become increasingly difficult .
third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding
asset positions .
and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .
enron wholesale services
today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate
our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale
businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and
coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to
higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of
opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of
enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and
markets .
enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european
( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets
operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit
as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant
businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this
new structure as described below .
mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume
the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,
currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office
of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .
providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership
positions :
rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president
and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility
for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north
america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo
will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will
report to the ews office of the chairman .
sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the
middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our
broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region
will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of
the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for
enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business
into enron global assets in the near future .
diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined
ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will
focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to
the ebs office of the chairman .
jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees
to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order
to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to
facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for
at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south
america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to
the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the
transition , jim will join ees .
in addition to these changes in our international asset operations
activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale
businesses and the commercial support functions :
enron net works
louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and
ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .
enron americas
concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for
operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,
marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report
into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility
for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south
america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief
operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron
americas .
enron europe
the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia
and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john
sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .
enron global markets
enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and
ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have
responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the
exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and
associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to
enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the
commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,
equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .
enron industrial markets
enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,
president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .
commercial support for ews
the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,
the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in
the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .
to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across
ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these
newly defined roles are as follows :
mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office
operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,
with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice
president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated
services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these
services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible
for specific commodities and / or geographic locations .
legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews .
regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a
regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in
the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all
european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue
to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions
and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief
of staff .
public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional
basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity ,
enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue
in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler
will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as
well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets .
these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship
to mark palmer , vice president of communications .
business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover
ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america .
attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale
services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes .
enron global exploration and production
and enron wind
as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments
around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to
egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff
baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron
wind , will report to cliff .
corporate staff
we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources ,
government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in
that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and
community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and
chief of staff .
committee structure
in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s
growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our
business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to
be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and
the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be
drawing on this group to lead company - wide initiatives such as the
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses .
the executive committee membership is shown on the attached list .
we are also forming a new committee  ) the enron corporate policy committee .
this group will be responsible for overall corporate policy , personnel
management policy and corporate strategy . the enron corporate policy
committee membership is also shown on the attached list .
we are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to
our highest return opportunities . please join us in congratulating and
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles .",0,1,0.01978252392036689,False Positive

with respect to ( 1 ) , if ena can ' t effectively manage the plant ' s positions , who can you recommend that could under the same terms ? as you recall , the equity owners do have a buyer interested in the asset , so the arrangement would probably be short - term at best .
i think the bank that has collateral rights to the asset will be concerned with the payable . with respect to ( 2 ) , did your discussions with legal lead to any conclusions with respect to compensating the project ? what is the amount of the claim the project has back to ena ? i agree that the project should make payments directly to the suppliers and lone star .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

good afternoon everyone ,
i would like to present megan jones for consideration of the sr . specialist
position ( job 103143 )
as for your essential requirements , she meets and exceeds them all .
accounting degree from ut , very detailed , knowledge of the gas industry ,
excellent communication skills , and over 2 years of experience .
regarding essential functions , she could perform them right away . her
resume shows detail of experience .
megan left coral energy to get into a department at sonat which would
provide her more of a challenge . she was truly being utilized as a
"" bean - counter "" and wanted more interaction with others . she went to work at
sonat which she says is the best job she ever had . she enjoyed the company ,
people , everything . . . as you know , sonat was bought by el paso which ended
her position along with others in her department .
she honestly took her current position in haste , but also thought it would
give her the experience of using her accounting skills , but having more
interaction with others in an audit capacity . this has not been the case .
she misses the industry , and learns quickly , very social and has no problem
interacting with people at all levels .
let me know your thoughts and any questions you may have .
best regards ,

madonna enrolls at prestigious university
pop queen madonna is so frustrated she sacrificed her education for pop music - she ' s allegedly enrolled at britain ' s prestigious oxford university for a degree in english literature . the material girl rekindled her love of books after writing popular children ' s series the english roses , and is looking forward to studying for a bachelor of arts qualification from home , with the celebrated institution which counts four british kings , 47 nobel prize - winners , 25 british prime ministers and six saints as past students . an insider tells britain ' s the sun newspaper , madonna was always irritated about giving up her schooling when her career took off . she is fiercely intelligent and incredibly well read and has always taken a keen interest in literature . she is determined to get a qualification . she sets herself new challenges all the time and the oxford university course is her latest . it ' s an illustrious place to study and she was delighted to be accepted and will make the most of the opportunity .

"Subject: this was the one recommended to me
finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

from : mr . richard mayer
dear friend ,
i am mr . richard mayer , the accountant general of nedbank of south
africa . i request your co - operation in the transfer of money amounting to
u . s . d . 32 million .
on september 2001 , an american pilot , mr . roy kenob , an american ational
made a fixed deposit of u . s d 32 million in ned bank of south africa . on
maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but gotno
reply . after a month , i sent a reminder and finally his employers
wrote to inform us that mr . kenob died in a plane crash , that he died without
making a will while our attempt to trace his next of kin through american
embassy proved fruitless .
when he was making deposition in my bank , he did not declare his next of
kin in his deposit application form , when i reminded him he said he
wished it so , in the conservative manner of our bank , i did not turn down
his request rather honor it considering his high net worth . the point is
that his employer are not aware of his deposit with us , therefore i am the
only person who know about mr . roy ' s deposit of u . s . d 32 , 000 , 000 . 00 which
is now lying in dormant account portfolio , the whole account relating to
mr . kenob ' s deposit is also with me .
i am looking forward for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of
kin to mr . roy . i have worked out modalities of achieving my aim by
appointing you as the next of kin to mr . roy as well as transfer the u . s . d
32 , 000 , 000 . 00 abroad for us to share . i will use an attorney who will represent
you as the beneficiary to execute series a written will and attestament
of late mr . roy kenob , in support of your claim including certificate of
origin of the money , letter of probate which empowers you as the sole trustee / executor
to the estate of mr . roy kenob . please note that you will not be required
to sign any transfer document , as the appointed attorney will do all
that .
if you agree to act as the next of kin / beneficiary to enable me
transfer / convert the money to our own benefit / use . i will give you 30 % of
usd 32 m , 60 % will be for me while 10 % will be to take care of all unforeseen
expenses as we may incure in the course of concluding this transaction .
i am urgently waiting for your positive reply on the address below .

"Subject: re : hungry mhetor cheating on spouse
i ' ve heard a lot about youlaagan
i must have women - - there is nothing unbends the mind like them . all fair in love and war . much violence is based on the illusion that life is a property to be defended and not to be shared . life is not a problem to be solved , but a reality to be experienced .
our thoughts take the wildest flight : even at the moment when they should arrange themselves in thoughtful order . kids use to ask where they came from , now they tell you where to go
i don ' t want to do business with those who don ' t make a profit , because they can ' t give the best service .
the liberals can understand everything but people who don ' t understand them .
a lie can run around the world six times while the truth is still trying to put on its pants . beware of no man more than of yourself we carry our worst enemies within us .
death , so called , is a thing which makes men weep , and yet a third of life is passed in sleep .
rest not . life is sweeping by go and dare before you die . something mighty and sublime , leave behind to conquer time .
listen ! encourage . say something . do something . be yourself . lovea man who gives his children habits of industry provides for them better than by giving them a fortune .
getting divorced just because you don ' t love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do . force without forecast is to little avail .
the problems of this world are only truly solved in two ways : by extinction or duplication .
our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how anybody or anything outside ourselves will affect us .

"Subject: i found something !
finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !
